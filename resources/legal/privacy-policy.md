# Privacy Policy for JellyRock

Last Updated: August 23, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the JellyRock application ("we," "our," or "the app") handles your information. JellyRock is a third-party client for accessing your personal Jellyfin media server.

We are committed to your privacy. This app collects minimal information strictly necessary for its function and does not transmit any personal data to our servers.

## 2. Information We Do Not Collect

We want to be perfectly clear: **We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal media information, server details, or usage data to any servers owned or controlled by us.**

## 3. Information Collected and Stored by the App

The JellyRock app operates by storing information locally on your Roku device to facilitate your connection to your Jellyfin server. This information is stored in the Roku's device registry and is not accessible by us or any other third party.

The app may store:

- Server Connection Details: The URL or IP address of your Jellyfin server.

- User Authentication Data: A secure token or user ID provided by your Jellyfin server to maintain your authenticated session. We do not have access to your Jellyfin username or password; all authentication is handled directly between your app and your Jellyfin server.

This data is used solely to connect to your server and act on your behalf. You can delete this stored data at any time by deleting the JellyRock channel from your Roku device.

## 4. Data Deletion

All data collected by the JellyRock app is deleted immediately upon removal of the channel from your Roku device.

## 5. Information Collected by Roku

Roku, Inc. collects certain information as part of your use of the Roku platform and channel store, in accordance with their own privacy practices. This is outside of our control.
