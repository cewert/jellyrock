# End-to-End Tests

**Purpose:** Test complete user journeys through the application UI.

**Status:** ðŸš§ Placeholder for future implementation

**Planned Tool:** [RTA (Roku Test Automation)](https://github.com/triwav/roku-test-automation)

**When to use:**

- Testing critical user flows (login, playback, navigation)
- Testing across different Roku device models
- Regression testing before major releases
- UI automation with remote control simulation

**Characteristics:**

- Requires actual Roku device
- Slowest execution (minutes)
- High confidence in real-world behavior
- Run before releases or nightly

**Future Implementation:**

- Add RTA as dev dependency
- Create test scenarios for critical paths
- Integrate with CI/CD for release builds
